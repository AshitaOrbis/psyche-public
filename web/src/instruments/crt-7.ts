/**
 * Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT-7)
 * Extended version by Toplak et al. (2014)
 * Tests analytical vs intuitive thinking
 *
 * !! RECURRING DEPLOYMENT BUG — READ BEFORE TOUCHING !!
 *
 * CRT is the ONLY instrument that mixes response types:
 *   - Items 1-6: { type: "numeric" } — answers are numbers (5, 5, 47, 4, 29, 20)
 *   - Item 7:    { type: "text" }    — answer is a letter ("c")
 *
 * Every InstrumentRunner component (standalone, tier-2 Astro, tier-3 Next.js)
 * MUST handle the "text" response type or CRT-7 renders a blank question.
 * This has broken on deployment TWICE (2026-03-19, 2026-03-20) because the
 * extracted InstrumentRunner components only handled likert/binary/numeric/
 * multiple-choice, silently dropping the text case.
 *
 * If you extract or refactor InstrumentRunner, grep for 'response.type' and
 * verify ALL five types are handled: likert, binary, numeric, text, multiple-choice.
 *
 * CRT answers also include values like 47, 29, 20 — do NOT clamp response values
 * to [0,10] or any Likert-like range. Only clamp *normalized* scores.
